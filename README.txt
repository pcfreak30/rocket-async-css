WordPress plugin to combine all inline, external, and remote CSS and load async. Depends on WP-Rocket

This is NOT an official addon to WP-Rocket!

== Description ==

This plugin will combine all inline and external CSS in the order found on the page and save it to WP-Rocket's cache folder as a new file. Files are grouped by their media attribute, defaulting to "all" if they have none. Async is powered by [https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS).

Filters `rocket_async_css_process_style` and `rocket_async_css_process_file` can be used to selectively exclude any inline CSS or external CSS from minify and async loading.

Examples are:

```php
function exclude_css($skip, $css){
    if ( false !== strpos( $css, 'something' ) ) {
			return false;
		}

	return $skip;
}
add_filter('rocket_async_css_process_style','exclude_css', 10, 2);

```

and

```php
function exclude_file($skip, $url){
    if ( 'some url' == $url ) {
			return false;
	}

	return $skip;
}
add_filter('rocket_async_css_process_style','exclude_file', 10, 2);

```

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
